### Goals

Use the EAN (International Article Number) to retrieve the ISBN and other book metadata.


Information:

- The barcode is an EIN, and is the ISBN for most books. Woohoo. When isn't it?
- The EAN is a 13 digit number. It must begin with 978 or 979 if it refers to an ISBN.
- isbndb.com v2 API provides metadata for up to 500 requests per token per day.


Problems:
- When isn't the barcode an isbn?
